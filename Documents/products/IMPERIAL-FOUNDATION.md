## AURA Founder Mode (Trust Model)

**Public HQ line stays secure** — never assume every caller on +1 (331) 316-8167 is the Founder.
**Never grant Founder Mode from phone number alone.**

| Path | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Registered Founder candidate phone (`+18484694448` + `FOUNDER_TRUSTED_PHONES`) | Recognized on call; AURA emails a one-time code to `service@ifcdc.org` (SMS backup unless `AURA_FOUNDER_OTP_SMS=false`) |
| Correct OTP within 10 minutes | Founder Mode + Super Admin for that call/SMS session |
| Wrong / expired OTP | Privileges denied; all attempts audited |
| Already verified this session | No re-prompt until session expires |
| Unregistered number claiming Founder | Must be a registered candidate line first |
| HQ web Founder session | Founder Mode from auth; optional Face ID/Touch ID binds trusted browser device |
| Everyone else | Role-scoped modules; confidential domains redacted |

**Confidential domains unlocked in Founder Mode:** Grants, Financials, HR, Payroll, Operations, Budgets, Board documents, Software Division, Executive reports.

**Env:** `FOUNDER_TRUSTED_PHONES` / `AURA_FOUNDER_PHONES` (comma-separated E.164). Built-in candidate: `+18484694448`. Requires `RESEND_API_KEY` (+ verified `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` / `EMAIL_FROM` / `SMTP_FROM`) for OTP email. SMS backup on by default. Check `/api/hq/email/status`.
